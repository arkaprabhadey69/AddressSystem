# AddressSystem
AddressManagementSystem

This is a project about storing contacts and their address and other specific details in an addressbook. Thereafter, we can edit the details or even delete contacts.
We can also add multiple contacts to an addressbook at one go.
Furthermore, the problem has been refactored to add multiple addressbooks to a list of addressbooks, having UNIQUE addressbookname.
